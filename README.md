# Diabetes-Prediction
• Collected a publicly available diabetes dataset from the web and carried out data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data consistency and quality.

• Performed initial data analysis followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships between patient features and diabetes risk.

• Utilized scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data handling, visualization, and model development.

• Developed a Logistic Regression model to predict diabetes presence, achieving an accuracy of 70%.
